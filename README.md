# Demographic Data Analyzer

This project is part of my portfolio, demonstrating data analysis skills using Python, Pandas, and other data science tools. The project was inspired by a task from FreeCodeCamp's Data Analysis with Python certification.

## Project Overview

The Demographic Data Analyzer is designed to analyze demographic data to answer specific questions about the dataset. This analysis provides insights into various aspects such as race representation, educational levels, work hours, and income statistics.

## Features

- **Race Representation**: Analyze the representation of different races within the dataset.
- **Average Age of Men**: Calculate the average age of male individuals.
- **Educational Attainment**: Determine the percentage of people with different levels of education, including those with a Bachelor's degree.
- **Income Analysis by Education**: Compare income levels between people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) and those without.
- **Work Hours and Income**: Explore how work hours correlate with income, especially for those working the minimum number of hours.
- **Country Analysis**: Identify which country has the highest percentage of high earners.
- **Occupation Analysis**: Find the most popular occupation for high earners in India.

## How It Works

The analysis is conducted using Python, with Pandas as the main tool for data manipulation and analysis. Key calculations are implemented in the `demographic_data_analyzer.py` script. The results are validated with unit tests to ensure accuracy.

## Development Process

- **Data Preparation**: The data is imported and cleaned using Pandas to ensure accurate analysis.
- **Calculations**: Specific demographic questions are answered through data manipulation, filtering, and statistical calculations.
- **Testing**: Unit tests are implemented in `test_module.py` to validate each aspect of the analysis.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: For data processing and analysis.
- **Pandas**: To manipulate and analyze data efficiently.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: For visualizing data insights (if applicable).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For developing and testing code iteratively (development stage).

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arunjith-official/Demographic-Data-Analyzer
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the analysis:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
4. Review the analysis results and insights.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the ability to extract meaningful insights from demographic data using Python. It showcases data wrangling, statistical analysis, and critical thinking in interpreting data trends.
